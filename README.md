This project is a Simple Calculator Application developed using Python as part of my internship program at StaxTech for the Python Developer role. 
The purpose of this project is to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals, user interface development, and logic building by creating a practical and user-friendly calculator tool.
The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It is designed to provide users with a simple interface where they can input numbers and operators to perform calculations efficiently. 
The main goal of this project is to apply core programming concepts like functions, conditional statements, loops, and exception handling in a real-world application.
In addition to basic functionality, this project helped me understand how to structure a Python program, use modules effectively, and write clean and maintainable code.
I used functions to separate each arithmetic operation, which made the program easier to manage and scale. 
The calculator also includes input validation to prevent errors such as division by zero or invalid numeric inputs.
Working on this project provided valuable hands-on experience with Tkinter, which is a standard GUI toolkit in Python.
I learned how to create buttons, assign commands, and use layout managers to arrange elements on the screen.
As part of the internship, I also maintained proper code documentation and used Git for version control.
Improved understanding of core Python programming
Gained experience in designing user interfaces using Tkinter
Learned how to debug and test small applications
Practiced documenting code and managing versions using Git
This project marks an important step in my journey as a Python developer. It gave me the confidence to take on more advanced programming challenges and also laid the foundation for building larger applications in the future.
I am grateful to StaxTech for this opportunity and the guidance provided throughout the internship. 
I look forward to continuing my learning and contributing to more complex software development projects.
